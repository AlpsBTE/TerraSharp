# TerraPlusMinus

This plugin expands the height of a 1.18.1 Vanilla world to 1967. It will (eventually) generate outlines and correct heights of the real world.

‚ùå Don't even think about using this. It is hightly WIP!

The NMSInjection Part is from the plugin https://github.com/Hex27/TerraformGenerator and can be found there. Credits go to Hex27.
