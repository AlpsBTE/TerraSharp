`‚ùå Don't use this for building. World expansion is experimental.`

TerraPlusMinus is a plugin for 1.18.1 which generates the real world height and outlines in the projection of [BuildTheEarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_the_Earth).
Optionally it can expand the world height to 1967 ([more stable Paper Version for height expansion](https://github.com/Build-the-Earth-Germany/PaperPlusMinus/releases)).
